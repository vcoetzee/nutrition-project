## Title: Predicting body composition and blood pressure in a South African student population 
### Brief Introduction

### Aim
The aim of this study is to determine which demographic and/or lifestyle factors predict body composition and blood pressure in a South African student population.

### Methods
#### Data
The African Longitudinal Facial Appearance and Health Study (ALFAH) study was approved by research ethics committees at the Faculties of Health Sciences (259/2016), Natural and Agricultural Sciences (EC160429-024) and Humanities (25309995/ HUM030/0819) at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. Two hundred and seventy-one (N=271) African participants (53.3% male) aged 18 to 29 (mean: 20.79) were recruited for the study from the University of Pretoria and the Sefako Makgatho University, Pretoria, South Africa. Written informed sent was obtained from all participants. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire, including questions on basic demographic variables, their health, exercise and diet (in the past 7 days). Each participant's body weight, percentage body fat and body composition were measured with a Tanita MC 780 MA Segmental Body Composition Analyser; their blood pressure with an automated blood pressure monitor; their grip strength with a JAMAR Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer; and their standing and sitting height with a wall-mounted stadiometer. 

Two saliva samples were collected from each participant and DNA was extracted using the PSP SalivaGene system (Stratec molecular, Berlin Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples of 144 participants were genotyped at the Centre for Proteomic and Genomic Research (CPGR), South Africa, and DNA samples of a further 92 participants were genotyped at the Uppsala University Biomedical Centre, Sweden. Both facilities used the Illumina Infinium H3Africa v1 Assay. Only one sample had an SNP call rate <0.95. Participant data was distributed across three datasets: the main data set (containing questionnaire data, body composition, blood pressure, grip strength, standing and sitting height), genotyping dataset 1 (CPGR results) and genotyping dataset 2 (Uppsala University results). All datasets were uploaded to the mySQL nutrition database (nutrition-load-main-from-csv). Detailed descriptions of the datasets are provided in "nutrition-dataset-description.docx"
