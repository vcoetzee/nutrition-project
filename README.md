## Title: Is genetic-based, personalised nutrition a viable strategy to improve health in South Africa?

### Brief Introduction
Personalised nutrition is a promising emerging research field that could substantially improve public health. Whereas dietary advice generally follows a one-size-fits-all approach, personalised nutrition aims to improve individualsâ€™ health with a diet tailored to their individual biology, especially their genetics. Despite the relative immaturity of the field, commercial companies are already offering DNA diet packages to improve dietary recommendations based on genetic testing.

### Aim
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether genetic-based, personalised nutrition could be a viable option to improve health in South Africa.

### Objectives
* Identify the most promising genetic variants associated with diet associated health outcomes.
* Determine the prevalence of these genetic variants in African and South African populations.
* Determine the association between these genetic variants, diet and diet associated health outcomes.

### Methods
The African Longitudinal Facial Appearance and Health Study (ALFAH) study was approved by research ethics committees at the Faculties of Health Sciences (259/2016), Natural and Agricultural Sciences (EC160429-024) and Humanities (25309995/ HUM030/0819) at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. Two hundred and seventy one (N=271) African participants (53.3% male) aged 18 to 29 (mean: 20.79) were recruited for the study. Participant data was distributed across three datasets: the main data set (containing demographic, health, food frequency, segmental body fat and muscle data on participants), genotyping dataset 1 and 2 (each contained genotype data on a subset of participants). The main data file was uploaded to the mySQL nutrition database using mySQL 8.0 command line client (see load-main-from-csv.txt). Exploratory data analyses were performed in mySQL 8.0 (see main-eda.txt)
