## Title: Is genetic-based, personalised nutrition a viable strategy to improve health in South Africa?

### Brief Introduction
Personalised nutrition is a promising emerging research field that could substantially improve public health. Whereas dietary advice generally follows a one-size-fits-all approach, personalised nutrition aims to improve individualsâ€™ health with a diet tailored to their individual biology, especially their genetics. Despite the relative immaturity of the field, companies such as DNALYSIS are already offering DNA diet packages to improve dietary recommendations based on genetic testing.

### Aim
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether genetic-based, personalised nutrition could be a viable option to improve health in South Africa.

### Objectives
* Identify the most promising genetic variants associated with diet associated health outcomes.
* Determine the prevalence of these genetic variants in African and South African populations.
* Determine the association between these genetic variants, diet and diet associated health outcomes.

### Methods
Three datasets were included in the project: the main data file (containing demographic, health, food frequency, segmental body fat and muscle data on participants and genotyping datasets 1 and 2 (each contained genotype data on a subset of participants). The main data file was uploaded to the mySQL nutrition database (MySQL 8.0; load-main-from-csv.txt).
